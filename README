Stackable Items

Allows you to change the default stack size of items. 

Todo/Ideas:
* Fix Tool stacking when used
* Fix chest stacking maxing out at 64
* Separate chest/player amounts
* Virtual Stacks (stack of tools that each are unique)
* Fix right clicking functionality on a stack larger than its normal max size
* Permissions
* Configurations per group (w/ Permissions?)
- I'm sure I'll think of/find more
