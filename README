Stackable Items

Allows you to change the default stack size of items. 

Todo/Ideas:
* Improve Shift Clicking
* Virtual Stacks (stack of tools that each are unique) (Partially implemented)
* Separate chest/player amounts
* Look into making work with InventoryTweaks (or possible API?) 
- I'm sure I'll think of/find more


Changelog:

Coming soon:
* Can no longer craft larger stacks than you're allowed to.
* Custom adding of items to inventory fixed
* Fixed infinite stack bug with large stacks for people without permissions to use large stacks.
* Items no longer bounce around when picking up if the stack size is normally bigger.
* Added /si as an alias for /stackableitems
* In-game commands to set/adjust stack amounts

Version 0.8.3 (6/21/2012)
* Fix Shift Clicking (mostly)
* Fixed id's in config files
* Player's cannot pick up larger stacks than their permissions allow for.

Version 0.8.2 (6/3/2012)
* Fixed an exception when Vault wasn't found.
* Fixed unenchanted items combining with enchanted items when picked up

Version 0.8.1 (5/18/2012)
* Fixed file writing issues

Version 0.8 (5/14/2012)
* Fixed duplication bug with crafting
* Removed unnecessary defaultTools and customTools configs.
* Made config check player.yml before group.yml as player should be able to override group.
* Fix chest stacking maxing out at 64 (Client won't show the correct number above 64)
* Capping max items to 127 due to item loss after reloading. (I have an idea for a workaround, so it may come back)
* Fixed unstacking bug when a stack of tools was separated after max being set to normal (-1) again.
* Right clicking on a stack while holding another drops items one at a time as vanilla does.
* Fixed large stacks from being put in armor slots, enchantment tables, and brewing stands.
* Item groups
* Added /stackableitems reload command to reload config files
* All config/item files are loaded into the plugin now when users need them, which means less i/o and possibly faster
* Item files should now handle any case -> IRON_BOOTS, iron_boots, IrOn_BOOts should all work.
* Added optional furnace stack amount which allows furnaces to stack above 64 (65-127 or -1 for disabled). 
** The client won't show it correctly, and the server can't smelt above 64 so it is faked (reverts to 63 and a counter saved) until picked up or the furnace is destroyed
* Now ignores creative mode so that items can be removed properly (temp fix)
