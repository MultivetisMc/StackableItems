Stackable Items

Allows you to change the default stack size of items. 

Todo/Ideas:
* Improve Shift Clicking
* Improve in-game commands
* Virtual Stacks (stack of tools that each are unique) (Partially implemented)
* Look into making work with InventoryTweaks (or possible API?)
- I'm sure I'll think of/find more


Changelog:

Coming soon:
* Use stacks in Brewing stand option was setting the crafting option again.
* Fixed repairing when using RepairRecipe plugin.
* Fixed some duplication bugs with crafting tables.
* Fixed duplication bug with brewing stands.
* Fixed a bug with default config using the group config.
* Added chestItems.yml to allow setting different stack amounts in chests.
* Fixed a bug with stacking that caused loss of items.

Version 0.8.8 (9/10/2012)
* Fixed some potential NPEs
* Fixed permissions to handle Vault properly when it is not found.
* Adding Java Version for Metrics to gather. This should tell me if I need to compile against an older version or can compile against a newer version of java.  If I don't get anything useful out of this, I'll remove it in the next version.
* Prevent written books as well as book and quills from stacking to prevent duplication. This is a temporary fix until bukkit implements a Book API
* Fixed some inconsistencies with stack amounts

Version 0.8.7 (8/26/2012):
* Added debug option.  If you want to help me test issues, set this to true.  If you start getting spammed with messages in the console, report those to github. At any point, you can set this to false to stop getting messages (after a "/si reload")
** Will also be used from now on to prevent random message spam from my testing if I don't take them out before release.
* Adding Metrics support. To opt out, set "opt-out: true" in PluginMetrics/config.yml
* Removed dependency on CraftBukkit needed for the pop sound when picking up items thanks to the new Sounds API.
* Fixed bow repairing
* Fixed shift clicking in Enchantment Tables
** If enchantment table is empty, first click will move 1 item to fill the slot.  Another click will switch it between main inventory and quickslots.
** Items that cannot be enchanted will be moved between the main inventory and quickslots.
* Fixed shift clicking on stacks of armor in order to equip one.
* Fixed options to use stacks in merchant and crafting using the furnace option instead of their own.
* Added Use_Stack_Amounts_In_Brewing
* Fixed shift clicking in Brewing Stands and regular clicking in the ingredient slot.
* Improved shift clicking in Crafting window
* Fixed crafting recipes that use -1 durability for any durability


Version 0.8.6 (8/12/2012)
* Fixed(hopefully) a null pointer exception when eating food
* Shift clicking support in furnaces
** Overrides default shift clicking to work as follows:
** 1. Is the item a fuel? If so, check the fuel slot and move it there if you can. If not a fuel or fuel slot is full->
** 2. Is the item used in any furnace recipe? If so, add it to the ingredient slot if possible. If not used in any recipes->
** 3. Move the item between hotbar and main inventory.
** Added lists/defaultFuels.txt and lists/customFuels.txt
** /lists/defaultFuels.txt - This is a default fuel list that I provide and can update between versions (there is also a version # to this file which is listed at the top). This file will be used if customFuels.txt is empty
** /lists/customFuels.txt - If an update comes out that adds more fuels and I disappear off the face of the planet or you have another plugin that uses something else as a fuel, this can be used to keep updated or add custom fuels. If there is anything in this file, it will override anything in defaultFuels.
* No longer overriding armor in crafting inventory
* No longer overriding repairing recipes
* Mushroom soup will not be fake consumed when you lose hunger
* Fixed bucket stacking
* Renamed config.yml to options.yml to hopefully avoid confusion in the future.
** options renamed to avoid spaces
* Switched cmdMain and cmdMainAlt - Should fix conflicts with OpenInv
* Fixed picking up and dropping items causing them to be removed/glitchy.
* Fixed shift clicking in ender chests and villager trading.
* Any clicking on the villager trading Result slot will use vanilla behavior to prevent item loss/duplication. (until Bukkit implements a trading api)
* New config option: useStackAmountsInFurnace - True: Players can only put in the amount they are allowed, False: Furnaces hold their normal amount, no matter what players can stack to
** Also useStackAmountsInTrading and useStackAmountsInCrafting. (False is defaulted for all three) (These may eventually turn into the way chests will be implemented, as in a unique file for each that allows setting all items as defaultItems.yml does)

Version 0.8.5 (7/28/2012)
* In-game commands for setting stack amounts and reloading now require players to be an op or have permission "- stackableitems.adjust"

Version 0.8 (5/14/2012)
* Fixed duplication bug with crafting

* Fix chest stacking maxing out at 64 (Client won't show the correct number above 64)
* Capping max items to 127 due to item loss after reloading. (I have an idea for a workaround, so it may come back)
* Fixed unstacking bug when a stack of tools was separated after max being set to normal (-1) again.
* Right clicking on a stack while holding another drops items one at a time as vanilla does.
* Fixed large stacks from being put in armor slots, enchantment tables, and brewing stands.
* Item groups
* Added /stackableitems reload command to reload config files
* All config/item files are loaded into the plugin now when users need them, which means less i/o and possibly faster
* Item files should now handle any case -> IRON_BOOTS, iron_boots, IrOn_BOOts should all work.
* Added optional furnace stack amount which allows furnaces to stack above 64 (65-127 or -1 for disabled). 
** The client won't show it correctly, and the server can't smelt above 64 so it is faked (reverts to 63 and a counter saved) until picked up or the furnace is destroyed
* Now ignores creative mode so that items can be removed properly (temp fix)
