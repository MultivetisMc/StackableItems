Stackable Items

Allows you to change the default stack size of items. 

Todo/Ideas:
* Fix Shift clicking
* Virtual Stacks (stack of tools that each are unique) (Partially implemented)
* Separate chest/player amounts
* In-game commands to set/adjust stack amounts
* Look into making work with InventoryTweaks (or possible API?) 
* Look into problems with RealShop
- I'm sure I'll think of/find more


Changelog:

Coming soon:
* Fixed duplication bug with crafting
* Removed unnecessary defaultTools and customTools configs.
* Made config check player.yml before group.yml as player should be able to override group.
* Fix chest stacking maxing out at 64 (Client won't show the correct number above 64)
* Capping max items to 127 due to item loss after reloading. (I have an idea for a workaround, so it may come back)
* Fixed unstacking bug when a stack of tools was separated after max being set to normal (-1) again.
* Right clicking on a stack while holding another drops items one at a time as vanilla does.
* Fixed large stacks from being put in armor slots, enchantment tables, and brewing stands.
